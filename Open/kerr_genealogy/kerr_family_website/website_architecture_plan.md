# Kerr Family Genealogy Website: Architecture & Implementation Plan

## Website Overview

The Kerr Family Genealogy Website will be a comprehensive, interactive digital platform that presents the rich history, connections, and stories of the Kerr family across generations. With special emphasis on both horizontal expansion (extended family connections to California, Louisiana, and overseas) and vertical depth (ancestry tracing), the site will combine elegant design with powerful interactive tools to create an engaging, informative experience.

## Core Objectives

1. **Present comprehensive family data** in accessible, engaging formats
2. **Highlight extended family connections** across geographic locations
3. **Visualize family relationships** including complex and non-traditional structures
4. **Showcase migration patterns** from Michigan to California, Louisiana, and beyond
5. **Integrate historical context** with family timelines
6. **Preserve and share family stories** and "cool facts"
7. **Enable interactive exploration** of the family tree and connections
8. **Create a visually beautiful experience** honoring family heritage
9. **Ensure responsiveness** across all devices
10. **Allow for future expansion** as new information is discovered
