# Temporal Correlation Analysis: Kerr Family

## Overview
This analysis examines key life events (births, marriages, deaths) that occurred in close temporal proximity (within 2-5 year windows) across the Kerr family history. By identifying these temporal clusters and correlating them with historical events, we can better understand how broader social, economic, and political contexts influenced family decisions and experiences.

## Significant Temporal Clusters

### Late 1940s Convergence (1946-1948)

#### Family Events
1. **George Richard Mowry's Military Registration** (1946)
   - Registered for military service after World War II ended
   
2. **Birth of Debby Mowry** (circa February 1948)
   - Born to Donna Mowry and George Richard Mowry
   
3. **Marriage of George Richard Mowry and Patricia Corlyss Sheldon** (February 28, 1948)
   - Married in Otsego Township, Allegan, Michigan
   - Occurred in the same month as Debby's birth
   
4. **Potential beginning of relationship between Donna Mowry and Norman "Bud" Lowe** (late 1940s)
   - Timeline needs confirmation

#### Historical Context
- **Post-World War II Period** (1945-1950)
  - Economic prosperity and baby boom beginning
  - Return of servicemen and post-war marriage surge
  - Housing expansion and suburban development
  - Beginning of the Cold War tensions

#### Correlation Analysis
This cluster of events represents a critical formation period for the maternal line, occurring against the backdrop of post-WWII social changes. The compressed timeline—with George Richard Mowry having a child with Donna and marrying Patricia in the same month—suggests complex relationship dynamics possibly influenced by the rapid social changes of the post-war period.

**Research questions:**
- How did post-war social expectations influence these relationship decisions?
- Was George's military registration related to the Korean War buildup rather than WWII?
- Did economic opportunities of the post-war boom influence family formation patterns?

### 1950s Family Loss Cluster (1953-1955)

#### Family Events
1. **Death of George William Mowry** (1953)
   - Father of George Richard Mowry
   - Maternal great-grandfather to Jeff and Linsey
   
2. **Death of George Richard Mowry** (October 8, 1955)
   - Age 28 at death in Cooper Township, Kalamazoo
   - Father of Debby Mowry
   
3. **Potential solidification of relationship between Donna Mowry and Norman "Bud" Lowe** (mid-1950s)
   - Norman possibly becoming father figure to Debby after George's death

#### Historical Context
