Once this feedback is received, work can continue on completing the family narratives and proceeding with website architecture design and development.

## Conclusion

The Kerr Family Genealogy Project has made significant progress in organizing research, creating visually appealing visualizations, and beginning the narrative development. The completed work provides a solid foundation for the remaining tasks of finalizing narratives, designing the website architecture, developing the website, and deploying the final product.

The project is on track to deliver a comprehensive, elegant, and interactive family history website that honors the Kerr family legacy with special emphasis on the maternal lineage. The vintage-inspired design with modern functionality will ensure the family history is preserved and presented in a manner befitting its rich heritage.
