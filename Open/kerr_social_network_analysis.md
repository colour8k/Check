# Social Network Reconstruction: FAN Club Analysis

## Overview

This analysis employs the FAN Club methodology (Friends, Associates, and Neighbors) to identify and map interpersonal connections beyond direct family relationships within the Kerr family network. By examining individuals appearing in ancillary roles across family records and events, we can identify previously unarticulated social ties, community affiliations, and potential distant kinship connections that enrich our understanding of the family's social context.

## Methodology

This analysis examines multiple categories of connections:

1. **Event Witnesses** - Individuals present at births, marriages, and deaths
2. **Legal Document Participants** - Co-signers, witnesses, and other parties in legal/land transactions
3. **Neighbors** - Individuals living in proximity according to census and other records
4. **Professional Associates** - Colleagues, business partners, and work connections
5. **Community Affiliations** - Church members, organization participants, school cohorts
6. **Extended Social Circles** - Friends and other regular social contacts

For each identified connection, we evaluate:
- Frequency of appearance in family records
- Nature of relationship to core family
- Duration of connection over time
- Geographic proximity
- Potential kinship (including potential distant relations)
