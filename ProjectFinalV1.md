# Kerr Family Genealogy Website: Project Status Report

## Project Overview

This report provides a comprehensive overview of the current status of the Kerr Family Genealogy Website project, including work completed, challenges encountered, and next steps for completion.

The project aims to create an interactive website to document and showcase the Kerr family history, with a special emphasis on family relationships, geographic information, and historical narratives. The website features interactive visualizations including a family tree, timeline, and geographic mapping.

## Current Project Status

### Repository Structure

The project is currently being developed in a fresh Next.js application located at:
```
/home/scrapybara/kerr-website/
```

This clean environment was created after encountering encoding issues with the original files in:
```
/home/scrapybara/Check/Open/kerr-family-site/
```

### Completed Components

1. **Project Setup**
   - Next.js 15+ project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
   - Folder structure for components, pages, and data
   - Data models and API utilities for accessing family information

2. **Core UI Components**
   - `Header.tsx` - Site navigation with responsive design
   - `Footer.tsx` - Site footer with links and information
   - `PersonCard.tsx` - Reusable component for displaying person information
   - `AppWrapper.tsx` - Layout wrapper component for consistent page structure

3. **Pages**
   - Home page (`app/page.tsx`) - Landing page with featured family members
   - Family Tree page (`app/family-tree/page.tsx`) - Interactive family tree visualization
   - People Directory (`app/people/page.tsx`) - Searchable directory of family members
   - Person Profile (`app/people/[id]/page.tsx`) - Detailed page for individual family members

4. **Data Integration**
   - JSON data files copied from original project 
   - API utilities in `src/lib/api.ts` for data access
   - Family data structure defined with TypeScript interfaces

5. **Visualizations**
   - Initial implementation of `FamilyTree.tsx` component using D3.js

### Current Technical Challenges

The main challenge currently facing the project is a runtime error in the Next.js application. The error occurs in the `app/layout.tsx` file and appears to be related to the integration of client components in the server component layout.

Error message:
```
Error: ./app/layout.tsx:1:38
Parsing ecmascript source code failed
> 1 | import type { Metadata } from 'next';\nimport { Inter } from 'next/font/google';\nimport './globals.css';\n
```

This issue needs to be resolved before the website can be viewed and tested properly.

## Data Structure

The family data is stored in JSON format with the following key files:

1. **`public/data/family.json`**
   - Contains the core family data
   - Primary structure includes an array of `people` objects
   - Each person has properties for name, dates, relationships, etc.

2. **`public/data/extended_family.json`**
   - Contains information about extended family members
   - Follows the same structure as the main family data

The data structure is defined in TypeScript interfaces in `src/lib/api.ts`:

```typescript
export interface Person {
  id: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  middleName?: string;
  maidenName?: string;
  nickname?: string;
  birthDate?: string;
  deathDate?: string;
  branch?: 'core' | 'paternal' | 'maternal' | 'california' | 'louisiana' | 'extended';
  generation?: number;
  location?: string;
  bio?: string;
  photo?: string;
  relationships?: Relationship[];
}

export interface Relationship {
  type: 'spouse' | 'partner' | 'child' | 'parent' | 'sibling' | 'raised' | 'raised-by' | 'step-parent' | 'step-child' | 'adopted' | 'adopted-by';
  personId: string;
  years?: string;
}
```

## Development Roadmap

To complete the project, the following steps need to be taken:

### 1. Fix Technical Issues

- **Priority: HIGH**
- Resolve the layout rendering issue in Next.js
- Possible solutions:
  - Restructure the app to use client components more effectively
  - Modify the layout to avoid import issues
  - Check for TypeScript configuration issues

### 2. Complete Core Visualizations

- **Priority: HIGH**
- Finish the family tree visualization implementation
  - Add proper zooming and panning capabilities
  - Implement different tree layout options (vertical, horizontal, fan)
  - Add relationship highlighting
- Implement geographic visualization using Leaflet.js
  - Show family migration patterns
  - Display significant locations

### 3. Enhance User Experience

- **Priority: MEDIUM**
- Add robust search functionality across all family data
- Implement filtering by branch, generation, location
- Improve responsive design for mobile users
- Add loading states and transitions

### 4. Implement Timeline Feature

- **Priority: MEDIUM**
- Create interactive timeline of family events
- Show historical context alongside family events
- Allow filtering by person or event type

### 5. Add Media and Content Features

- **Priority: MEDIUM**
- Implement photo gallery for family images
- Add document viewer for family artifacts
- Integrate narrative content from research documents

### 6. Optimize and Test

- **Priority: LOW**
- Implement code splitting for performance
- Add image optimization
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Test across different browsers and devices

## Key Files and Locations

## Implementation Notes

### Family Tree Visualization

The family tree visualization is implemented using D3.js. The current implementation:

- Creates a hierarchical tree layout based on parent-child relationships
- Displays person nodes with names and birth/death years
- Allows clicking on nodes to view person details
- Uses color coding based on family branch

To complete the visualization:
1. Fix the parent-child relationship detection in the hierarchy builder
2. Add support for different tree layouts
3. Implement proper zooming and panning controls
4. Add visual indicators for different relationship types

### Data Flow Architecture

The application uses a client-side data fetching approach:
1. JSON data is stored in the public directory
2. Pages fetch data using the fetch API
3. API utilities in `src/lib/api.ts` provide strongly typed access to data
4. React state manages the UI based on loaded data

### UI/UX Considerations

- The site uses a consistent color scheme with slate blue for headers and amber accents
- Person cards have three variants: default, compact, and detail
- The layout is responsive with mobile-first design principles
- Navigation is consistent across all pages

## Technical Specifications

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.2
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Visualization Libraries**:
  - D3.js (for family tree)
  - Leaflet.js (for maps, to be implemented)
- **Data Format**: JSON
- **Deployment**: Can be deployed to Vercel, Netlify, or similar

## Conclusion and Next Steps

The Kerr Family Genealogy Website has a solid foundation with the basic structure and components in place. The immediate focus should be on resolving the rendering issues with the layout component to get the website functional. Once this is addressed, the interactive visualizations can be completed, followed by enhancing the user experience and adding additional features.

When picking up this project again:

1. Start by fixing the layout rendering issue
2. Complete the family tree visualization implementation
3. Add the geographic mapping component
4. Implement the timeline feature
5. Enhance the search and filtering functionality
6. Add media galleries and narrative content

With this roadmap, the Kerr Family Genealogy Website can be completed successfully, creating an engaging platform for exploring and preserving family history.
