# Kerr Family Genealogy - Data Structure Documentation

This document outlines the data structure for the Kerr Family Genealogy project, showing how family information is organized and how to add new family members to the database.

## Core Data Structure

The family data is stored in JSON format with the following primary structure:

```json
{
  "people": [
    {
      "id": "unique-identifier",
      "firstName": "First",
      "lastName": "Last",
      "middleName": "Optional",
      "maidenName": "Optional",
      "nickname": "Optional",
      "birthDate": "Date string",
      "deathDate": "Date string",
      "branch": "paternal|maternal|core|california|louisiana|extended",
      "generation": 1,
      "location": "Current location",
      "bio": "Short biography",
      "photo": "path/to/photo.jpg",
      "relationships": [
        {
          "type": "relationship-type",
          "personId": "related-person-id",
          "years": "optional date range"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Adding New Family Members

To add a new family member to the database:

1. Create a new person object with a unique `id` (use kebab-case, e.g., "john-smith")
2. Fill in the required fields (`id`, `firstName`, `lastName`)
3. Add as many optional fields as available
4. Add to the `relationships` array to connect to existing family members
5. Add the new person object to the appropriate JSON file:
   - For core Kerr family members: add to `family.json`
   - For extended connections: add to `extended_family.json`

## Example: Adding a New Family Member

```json
// New person to add to extended_family.json
{
  "id": "emily-welch",
  "firstName": "Emily",
  "lastName": "Welch",
  "branch": "extended",
  "bio": "Emily Welch is Melissa's sister.",
  "relationships": [
    { "type": "sibling", "personId": "melissa-welch-smith" },
    { "type": "child", "personId": "dawn-welch" },
    { "type": "child", "personId": "robert-welch-hennessy" }
  ]
}
```

## API Utilities

The website includes utility functions in `src/lib/api.ts` for working with family data:

- `getFamilyData()` - Fetches all family data
- `getPersonById(id)` - Gets a specific person by ID
- `getPeopleByBranch(branch)` - Gets all people in a specific branch
- `getPeopleByGeneration(generation)` - Gets all people in a specific generation
- `getAllPeople()` - Gets all people in the database
- `getRelationshipsForPerson(personId)` - Gets relationships for a specific person
- `getExtendedFamilyData()` - Gets all extended family members

## Data Visualization Mapping

The various visualizations use the following data mappings:

### Family Tree

- **Node:** Each person
- **Link:** Parent-child relationships
- **Group:** Family branch
- **Color:** Gender/branch coding

### Geographic Map

- **Marker:** Significant locations
- **Line:** Migration paths
- **Color:** Family branch
- **Popup:** Person information

### Timeline

- **Point:** Life events (birth, marriage, death, etc.)
- **Track:** Person's lifetime
- **Group:** Generation
- **Color:** Event type

## Conclusion

This data structure provides a flexible framework for representing the Kerr family genealogy and related connections. The relational structure allows for complex family relationships to be modeled accurately, while the branch categorization helps organize family members into meaningful groups.

As new information becomes available, additional fields can be added to the schema to capture more detailed family history.
